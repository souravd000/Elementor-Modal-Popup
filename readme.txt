== Description ==


This **Modal Maker Plugin** enhances your website’s interactivity by allowing you to add a fully customizable button that triggers a modal popup. Perfect for displaying additional content, product links, or call-to-action options, this plugin integrates seamlessly with Elementor and provides complete control over modal appearance and content type.

### Key Features

1. **Customizable Trigger Button:**  
   Easily configure the trigger button's text, colors, and typography to match your site’s design. The plugin includes responsive controls for padding, border styling, and shadow options, making it simple to achieve a tailored look.

2. **Multiple Content Options Inside Modal:**  
   - **Button Group:** Display a collection of buttons, each with customizable links, that users can click to navigate to different URLs. This is ideal for popups containing multiple calls to action, such as links to products, services, or resources.
   - **Rich Text Editor:** Use the editor to add custom HTML or formatted text inside the modal, perfect for showcasing information, adding product descriptions, or embedding videos and images.

3. **Independent Functionality for Multiple Instances:**  
   Each modal widget instance operates independently, allowing you to add multiple modals to the same page without conflicts. Unique IDs are automatically generated for each modal, ensuring only the corresponding modal opens when each button is clicked.

### How It Works

  Simply add the widget to your Elementor page and configure the button and modal settings in the editor panel. Choose between a button group or rich text editor for the modal’s content, and set up links if using buttons.
  
- **Styling Options:**  
  Use Elementor’s familiar controls to customize button width, colors, border radius, and shadow. You can also set modal dimensions to small, medium, or large to accommodate different types of content. 

- **Responsiveness:**  
  Built-in responsive controls allow for optimized viewing on any device. Adjust button size, alignment, and padding for a polished look across desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

### Ideal Use Cases

- **Product Showcases:** Create product-specific popups with links to additional product pages or purchasing options.
